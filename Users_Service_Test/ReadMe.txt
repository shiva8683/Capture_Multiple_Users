Please run Add_Edit_Users_Test.cs test cases before DeleteUser.cs test cases because Add_Edit_Users_Test.cs will create/Edit user details in XML file in service project.
DeleteUser.cs test cases will take the first user details as default in XML file(from WCF service project) and will delete the details so the test case woun't fail.
